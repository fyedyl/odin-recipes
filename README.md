# odin-recipes
In this project I will create a website with links to multiple pages with great recipes on them. I will use all of the HTML skills I have aquired, and by doing so I will further my knowlage of HTML. By the end of this project I should be able to create HTML projects and push them to github, and I should understand the basics of HTML.
